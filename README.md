## Description

Markdown Generator allows its users to easily create Markdown without having actually having to Markdown.  There are lots of Markdown editors on the web, but I've yet to find one that provides a drag and drop interface,  Although Markdown is built to be easy to use, it's still has its own syntax to get accustomed with.  Markdown Generator allows users with no experience with Markdown to create well formatted documentation for their projects.

#### Technologies

- Markdown
- Built with Angular 4
